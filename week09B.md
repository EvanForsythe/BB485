## <ins>**Tutorial assignment**</ins> <a name="tut"></a>

- This week's tutorial assignment is to choose your final individual project and begin outlining the specific aims of your project. The project should be related to either Squeakuences (discussed last lecture) or antimicrobial peptide prediction (discussed this lecture). 

- For this assignment, begin describing your vision for a project. We will work together next week to refine the scope of the project.


1. What is the overarching goal of your project?

2. Create a bulleted list of the steps you'll take to accomplish your goals.

3. What type(s) of input data will you need? In what file format(s) do you expect these data to be?

4. What types of output (including file format) do you expect to produce?

5. What tools/software do you expect to use for your project (e.g. python, HPC job submission, specific software packages?)

6. How will you summarize/visualize/interpret your results?
